The time to reach the equilibrium state is approximately 40000 time steps. 
At this time the number of positions/time step as well as transitions/timestep doesn't change much.

The results show that the lower the temperature is in relation to the energy, the particle tend to transition to another state with lower probability.
This can be seen in figure? that the particle never transition even once for extremely low temperature.
For high temperature in relation to the energy, the particle tend to transitions with higher probability to the different states.
This can be seen in figure? that the particle transitions to the different states with equal probaility with very high temperature since all states are approximately just as frequently occuring.

The time to reach equilibirum varied for the different temperatures.
The time to reach equilibrium for extremely low and high temperatures was instantaneous.
And as the temperature doesn't go to the extreme in relation to the energy the 
The state of equilibrium can be seen where the probability of being in the different states don't change anymore over time.
As a consequence of these equal probabilities the probability of being in the middle will converge to 1-p_left-p_right.
